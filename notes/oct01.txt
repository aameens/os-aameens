Array vs. Vector

array:
* exact-size immutable set of n elements of m type
* stored in one complete block

vector:
* variable-size set of lements of m type
* contains 3 points of data when created:
    * capacity
    * size
    * data
        * pointer to heap for data storage
        * not necessarily stored in one block
        * nested vectors can be all over the place
