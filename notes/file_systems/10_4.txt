File System
* A graph of directories
* Each directory contains an element that acts as a folder
    * Example: files[data, permissions]
* There is a danger of infinite recursion due to symbolic and hard links
    * Symbolic Links: "pointers" in the file system
    * Hard Links

Examples of different File Systems:
* Windows
    * C: -> tree, F: -> tree, D: -> tree
* Others
    * Root -> /home -> tree
* Matters of case sensitivity and other details vary

Storage Systems
* SSD: banks of capacitors
    * the charge/discharge state of the capacitors represents the data
    * SSD capacitors are so tightly-packed that bit errors are common
        * as a result basically all SSD drives use ECC blocks to protect read/write
