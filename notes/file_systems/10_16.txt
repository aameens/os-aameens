Three modern types of storage:
    SSD: Solid State Drive
    HDD: Hard Disk Drive
    ISCSI: "the cloud"

Each level of RAID: X is the number of duplicates for each code block (1x write, 'X'x read)

RAID: 0 "gamer solution", incredibly risky but peak theoretical performance

RAID: 1 is perfectly fine for small/personal storage

RAID: 2 is min for always-on servers, since there will still be a redundancy when one disk is removed
    for maintenance/upgrade/corrupted

N disks, want to turn into M <= N disks means there are N-M redundancy disks

Encryption at Rest: aquired data is useless without the decryption key

Always follow best practices and use well-tested tools for en/de-cryption

CHECKPOINTS / SNAPSHOTS

old backup system
    '. take down the system
    2. update it
    3. then turn it back on

backup to a working system
    have to use checkpoints: copy-on-write
    backs up while things run/change

JOURNALING

logs changes as they happen, can find any failed changes if
    the log doesn't match the disk, and react accordingly
much easier to check if everything in the last journal time (ex. 15 sec) which is very small
    as opposed to the entire file system for correctness
