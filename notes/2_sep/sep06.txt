Decision Tree                               
Start has a p = 1.                          *
Next steps have sum(p) = 1.               / | \
    etc.                                   etc

Monte-Carlo - reroll the dice many times and analyze results to find probabilities, other data.
    can miss low-probability cases
Forks - consider each possible case of the dice roll, use set probability or other tools to find probabilities, other data.
    always finds every possible case
