Bit Error Rates
* Reality doesn't match the determinism assumed in computing
* Bit errors are rare enough that data storage not built to recover from them
* Bit error rate ~10^-3
    * Num. of computations per sec: ~10^9
    * Chance of bit error: ~10^-12
    * Servers: (AWS ~10^7 servers)
    * Seconds in a year: (3.15)*10^7
    * Bit errors per year (AWS): (3.15)*10^4

ECC RAM (Error Correcting Code)
* Has backup bits for every bit in RAM
    * Can detect up to 2 bit errors (per bit)
    * Can correct any 1 bit error (per bit)
* Therefore, assuming independence, 10^-24 = chance of 2 bit errors
* Much, much less likely to suffer a bit error, need incredible scale to consistenly see any

Profiling
* SSD tries to cache important information to RAM
    * RAM tries to cache important information to Core
* When many processes require more SSD/RAM/Core caching, system slows down to decrease need per process

Efficiency
* Efficient sort() algorithm is ~O(n log n) time
* Accessing one element in RAM/cache is not necessarily O(1) time
    * If page doesn't match from current element to new one, can take lots of effort to find in RAM/cache
