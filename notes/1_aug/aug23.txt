How to Copy a File:
    command: cp
    
    But what does a copy command look like?

When running a process:
    Interfacing with many tools, many libraries, in the system
        libc particularly fundamental to operation of useful programs, almost all useful programs in C interface with libc

: Kernel        : Kernel is the doorman for permissions for whether and how programs can modify memory; Every process uses same Kernel (like a pointer)
:_______________:
| Stack V       | Top of the stack ~127TB data points in memory (will never ever reach the bottom possible of RAM)
|               |
| Heap ^        |
| Globals       |
| Literals      |

| Code          | \
| write() etc.  |   CPU (core), PC (program counter)

Virtual Address Spaces
    MMU (Memory Mapping Unit): Maps VAS to physical space on the machine; MMU essentially part of the CPU
        VAS = registers between 0 and ~127TB used by program counter
        PAS = registers in the actual RAM, mapped from VAS by MMU
