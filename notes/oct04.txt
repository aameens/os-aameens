How ECC (Error Correcting Code) RAM works:
    11 bits -> 2^11 codes (2048)
    5 values
        each value: (ex) 10110110101
        11 bits means 11 possible 1-bit errors
    each value stored creates a "cloud" of every address that could be bit
    errored to
        means that 1 value takes up 12 bits in this example
    when a bit error occurs within the cloud, the ECC code sends it back to
    the intended bit

Mutex:
* Shared resource: a process, tool, or structure that multiple threads
    potentially want to use simultaneously
    * Example: only one person can use a chair at a tim, but multiple
        people may want to use it simultaneously
* #include <pthreads> and mutex ensures that one thread can access and
    modify the shared resource at a time, with efficient hand-offs
